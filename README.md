# SCOC Integration

## Overview

The SCoc Integration project encompasses a robust suite of tools designed to provide comprehensive security operations capabilities. This integration leverages the strengths of several powerful platforms to enhance threat detection, incident response, and overall security posture.

## Tools and Technologies

### Elasticsearch - Machine Learning

Elasticsearch's machine learning capabilities are integrated to provide advanced analytics and anomaly detection. This enables proactive identification of potential threats based on data patterns and trends.

### Wazuh

Wazuh serves as the core SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform in this integration. It offers a range of features, including:
- **SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management
- **EDR**: Endpoint Detection and Response
- **XDR**: Extended Detection and Response
- **TIP**: Threat Intelligence Platform
- **UEBA**: User and Entity Behavior Analytics
- **NTA**: Network Traffic Analysis

### Shuffle - SOAR

Shuffle is integrated as the SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform. It automates workflows and integrates with other security tools to streamline response processes and improve efficiency.

### DFIR-IRIS - Incident Response Platform

DFIR-IRIS is used as the incident response platform, providing comprehensive tools and workflows to manage and respond to security incidents effectively.

### MISP - Threat Intelligence Platform

MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is incorporated as the Threat Intelligence Platform. It facilitates the sharing, storing, and correlating of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and threat intelligence data.
